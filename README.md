# CoVTRxdb 
COVID-19 clinical trials

## Abstract

COVID-19 clinical trial initiation may not be driven by scientific need:
geographical and social biases appear to be confounders. 
To better understand these biases, 
we unified the catalog of drugs being tested into a database, CoVTRxdb,
and performed a global informatics-driven survey of clinical trial registrations. 
There have been 2,505 COVID-19 drug trials conducted as of September 4th 2020, 
with 1.92 million people enrolled. 
Although trial registration is correlated with outbreak severity in each country, 
the USA, China, and Iran are conducting the most trials.
16.2% of trials test hydroxychloroquine, the most frequently tested drug.
Of the 407 hydroxychloroquine trials, 
81.6% are randomised and 70% are combined with other drugs. 
Remarkably, Twitter activity appears to be closely associated with
hydroxychloroquine trial initiation.
Of 929,994 tweets discussing most frequently trialed COVID-19 drugs,
56.6% mentioned hydroxychloroquine.
Hydroxychloroquine trial prevalence is potentially associated with
social media attention, especially by world leaders.
Understanding biases in trial registration may allow governments
and policy makers to more effectively allocate resources 
and prioritize treatments for further testing.
