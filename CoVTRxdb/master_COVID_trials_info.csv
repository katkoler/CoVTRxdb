Therefore, hydroxychloroquine is NOT considered a trial intervention for the purpose of this study.<br><br>The dose of hydroxychloroquine used for COVID-19 infection is extrapolated from that in common use for malaria and other approved indications. However, the organ dysfuction that accompanies critical illness suggests dosing is likely to require adjustment. This study will adjust the dose of hydroxychloroquine using therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to a goal concentration known to be safe. The observation period for TDM will be a total of up to 10 days or until the time of ICU discharge, which ever is sooner.<br><br>As is routine practice at the RBWH ICU, TDM will be led by the senior ICU pharmacist after initiation of therapy. Trough venous blood samples (3 ml) will be taken via an indwelling arterial cannula. The first TDM should ideally occur before the administration of the FIRST MAINTENANCE DOSE, provided the appropriate loading dose schedule has been completed. Sampling thereafter can occur every 24-48 hours to confirm the appropriateness of ongoing dosing as guided by the Pharmacy and Medical Team.

The hood has a skirt that drapes down the sides of the bed and over the patients waist and does not seal around the patient. The hood relies upon air being drawn up the sides of the bed and from the front near the patient’s legs etc. up to the rear, i.e. away from the healthcare worker who is principally at the front/sides of the patient. The air passes through the fan and on through a High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter, thereafter returning to the hospital air environment.

Participants in the intervention group will be required to interact with a digital companion daily for at least 15 minutes per day over a one-week period. The digital companion will be a digital human, which is an animated, embodied conversational agent that uses artificial intelligence to provide social and emotional engagement. The interaction will involve completing two ‘resilience’ module with a digital companion. One module includes the following loneliness intervention techniques: increasing social support, increasing opportunity for social interaction, and increasing social skills. For example, participants will be encouraged to contact someone from their existing social network. A second 'resilience' module includes techniques for reducing loneliness-related distress such as psychoeducation about coping skills and a deep breathing exercise. Participants will be required to participate in at least one resilience module activity per day and then they will have the choice to complete other activities with the digital companion. Some of the other activities participants can do with the digital companion include finding out information about mental health resources and COVID-19.

One adult woman per household was enrolled for the program. Following enrolment, we randomly assigned them to either the telecounseling treatment arm, Arm 1, or to the control arm, Arm 2, where no counseling is provided to women. Therefore, our randomization is at the household (or individual) level. <br>Eventually, 1,299 women were assigned to Arm 1 and 1,103 women to Arm 2. We are running four fortnightly (every two weeks) tele-counseling sessions, each for 20 minutes, covering different aspects of the coronavirus’ impact on women’s physical and emotional wellbeing. Thus, the intervention will be given over two months. The four informational modules (delivered via interactive sessions using study-specific materials) that are being covered are on: (i) awareness of COVID-19, symptoms and preventive measures to address the fear of infection; (ii) taking care of emotional wellbeing to cope with stress; (iii) taking care of physical health of self and child to address health-related anxiety; and, (iv) helping each other and staying connected to cope with social distancing. <br>Sessions are delivered by locally recruited, trained female para counsellors.

Ritonavir is added to Lopinavir to enhance efficacy by increasing serum availability [3]. In-vitro experiments show viral susceptibility to the drug. A published series of patients treated with this Lopinavir-Ritonavir showed improved outcomes at 21 days after diagnosis, compared to historical controls. Lopinavir-Ritonavir has previously been shown to improve outcomes in animal models (marmosets) infected with MERS-CoV. A trial including 194 patients with advanced COVID-19 infection showed a small difference in time to clinical improvement, suggesting the need for further trials evaluating this drug. Though early studies have not shown any difference in post treatment viral load, some centres are using this drug combination off-label to treat COVID-19 patients. No work has yet looked at the impact of these drugs on pre-infection or pre-symptomatic treatment (or in vulnerable patients). Robust evidence is needed to prove or exclude the benefit of Lopinavir-Ritonavir use to prevent pulmonary complications in patients undergoing surgery.<br>Intervention2: Hydroxychloroquine: Hydroxychloroquine is usually used as an antimalarial drug and in auto-immune diseases such as Lupus and Rheumatoid Arthritis. Promising laboratory studies have shown that chloroquine decreases COVID-19 entrance and replication within cells, together with its known anti-inflammatory effect. From small early phase clinical trials in China that included more than 100 patients being treated for COVID-19 pneumonia, chloroquine was associated with a shorter course of disease and less pneumonia exacerbation.

To adjust this model, various individual aspects of transmission (aerosol-related transmission, droplet infection and smear infections) must be simulated in individual models or tests. For the aerosol-related transmission, an analysis of the indoor climate and the ventilation system is made, based on which the aerosol spread and concentration can be calculated (TP 3). For the other two transmission channels (droplet and smear infections), a major event is first analyzed using fire protection simulations for potential risk areas for crowds (TP 2) and then simulated with 4000 test subjects (TP 5). The intensity and duration of the contacts are measured using contact tracing devices and the risk areas for smear infections are determined using fluorescence techniques. Based on the results of the simulations, optimized process concepts are developed (TP 4) and then also reproduced with test subjects. The aim is to determine how the number of critical contacts or critical aerosol exposures can be reduced through such optimized concepts. In a second step, the model created in TP1 is adapted based on the data from the simulations and the experiments, and the effectiveness of optimized strategies on regional epidemiology is calculated (TP 7).

The questionnaire contains items that are only given once (e.g. items relating to the beginning of the pandemic) and items that can be given weekly. This questionnaire was checked for comprehensibility by 3 - 5 family doctors. The recruitment of the participants is carried out via the email distribution list of professional associations and existing family doctor research and teaching networks. The survey is conducted via the open source online tool LimeSurvey. Persons who have agreed to participate in a weekly survey in the first survey will be contacted weekly. Since each participant chooses a code that only he/she knows, it is possible to summarize the surveys belonging to one person longitudinally, but it is not possible to assign these answers to a specific person. This guarantees the anonymity of the respondents. <br>Evaluation: The questionnaire is evaluated descriptively. Primarily, the extent of existing deficiencies and problems is to be recognized. Therefore, the items are evaluated individually and no summary of the items is planned. For this reason, the answers are displayed in frequencies. In order to obtain a conclusion on the population, 95% confidence intervals are calculated for the frequencies. Possible group differences (e.g. ordination in the country vs. ordination in the city) are analysed exploratively by means of chi-square methods.

Intervention content, design and structure were optimised iteratively using in-depth qualitative ‘think-aloud’ interviews with members of the general public in order to ensure the intervention was accessible, credible and motivating for as many people as possible (Yardley et al. 2015).  Based on process evaluations of the original randomised controlled trial (Little et al., 2015) and previous public dissemination activities (Ainsworth et al., 2017), Germ Defence has been updated and streamlined for use since the coronavirus pandemic, including translation into 20 languages (including Traditional and Simple Chinese), and broadening the infection control behaviours that were recommended.

Eligible patients are randomly allocated between several treatment arms, each to be given in addition to the usual standard of care in the participating hospital: No additional treatment vs corticosteroids (for children only) vs azithromycin vs intravenous immunoglobulin (children only). In a factorial design, eligible patients are allocated simultaneously to no additional treatment vs convalescent plasma. The study allows a subsequent randomisation for patients with progressive COVID-19 (evidence of hypoxia [or in children a hyper-inflammatory state] and raised inflammatory markers): No additional treatment vs tocilizumab.
